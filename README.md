## Motivation <a name="Motivation"></a>

This project is capstone of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The goal of the project is to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms . 



## Descriptions <a name="Descriptions"></a>

The project shows how the stock price is predicted by using Machine Learning Models . The project follows the steps below:
1. Load historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

2. Check for missing values and data cleaning.
 
3. Process Exploratory Data Analysis.

7. Perform data preparation and feature engineering for machine learning.
8. 
9. Train the regression models.
10. 
11. Validate the models.
12. Select the best model and make a recommendation.
I use various machine learning models to see if they would preciously predict the stock price. These are the machine learning algorithms that I use in the project. Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regressor(SVR), LassoCV, RidgeCV, Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD).
The best model will recommend the best stock price prediction for the investors.
